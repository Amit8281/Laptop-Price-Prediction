Laptop Price Prediction
This project is a machine learning model designed to predict the prices of laptops based on various features such as processor type, RAM size, storage capacity, display size, brand, etc. The model is built using a supervised learning approach and can be useful for laptop manufacturers, retailers, or consumers to make informed decisions about pricing or purchasing laptops.
